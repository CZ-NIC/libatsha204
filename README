libatsha204
===========

Libatsha204 is a library providing easy communication with Atmel ATSHA204
cryptography chip.

ATSHA204 is safe storage for 32 bytes long keys that can be stored without
permission to read any data. These keys could be used only for
challenge-response authentication operations. The second part of ATSHA204 is OTP
(One Time Programmeable) memory for some vendor-specific informations.

Libatsha204 is implementing API for basic and most important features (but not
all of them) of ATSHA204 chip. Typical API function presents one chip's command
and provides abstraction from bit flags, packet's composition and communication
protocol. You probably will not be able to use libatsha204 without knowleadge of
basic properties of ATSHA204 and studying of the datasheet is still required.

The architecture of libatsha204 is multilayer. The most important bottom layers
are:

	- NI2C - I2C communication through native Linux kernel driver (production)
	- Emulation - The ATSHA204 chip is emulated by software (server part)
	- USB - Layer for USB dongle with ATSHA204  (AT88CK454BLACK Kit) (testing)
